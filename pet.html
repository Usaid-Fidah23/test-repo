        <h3>Taking care of pets</h3>
        <p>Grooming
            Regular brushing is important for both cats and dogs, and pets with longer hair may need to visit a professional groomer. Matted fur can cause health issues.
            Safety
            Keep your home safe and free of hazards like chemicals, medications, and loose wires.
            Exercise
            Exercise is important for your pet's health and happiness. For dogs, you can take them for walks, play fetch, or let them run at the dog park. Exercise can also keep your dog's mind energized.
            Supervision
            It's best to always keep an eye on your pet and know where they are.</p>
